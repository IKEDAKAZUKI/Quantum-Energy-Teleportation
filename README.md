# Quantum-Energy-Teleportation

The complete quantum code for quantum energy teleportation on an IBM quantum computer.
You can demonstrate quantum gate operations on your laptop using a classical emulator or a real quantum computer. 
The default code works without an IBM ID. No special knowledge is required.

To run the code on a real quantum computer, create an IBM ID from the website and replace "My_API_Token" with your own token.
All resources are free to use.
